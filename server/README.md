# Server directory
The server directory is used to create any backend logic for your Nuxt application. It supports [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) and other powerful features. The server/ directory contains API endpoints and server middleware for your project.

## API Routes
Nuxt will automatically read in any files in the ~/server/api directory to create API endpoints.

## Server Middleware
Nuxt will automatically read in any files in the ~/server/middleware to create server middleware for your project.
